ShadowCracker
=============

Shadow Cracker is a simple interactive program to crack (brute force) Linux passwords.

You'll need access to the password hash, normally found by cat /etc/shadow or caught by any other means.

This tool is also a good tool to check for your Linux system security and password stengh.

Use it, change it, comment it. Use it for good.

We are still developing, but the main goals are:

Phase 1 - Be more interactive than ever allowing for user inputs or just from reading the values from relevant sources.

Phase 2 - We'll focus on performance and ways to make it faster.

*****INSTRUCTIONS*****

You need Python and passlib (easy_install passlib).

User is not relevant for the cracking process at this point.

All other menus we'll guide you through.
